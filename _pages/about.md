I am currently a second year Ph.D. student of Electrical and Computer Engineering (DICE) at <a href='https://vita-group.github.io/index.html'>VITA</a> and I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pxFyKAIAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1">Prof. Zhangyang (Atlas) Wang</a>. I am currently working on Model- & Data-efficiency Algorithms, AI4Science (Biology & Material Sciences) and Learning to Optimize (L2O). I obtained my Bachelor's Degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021. I also collaborate closely with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=en">Yu Cheng</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SQpJmOgAAAAJ&hl=en">Bhavya Kailkhura</a>.
