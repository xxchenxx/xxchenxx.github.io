I am currently a first year Ph.D. student of Electrical and Computer Engineering (DICE) at <a href='https://vita-group.github.io/index.html'>VITA</a> and I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Zhangyang (Atlas) Wang. I am currently working on sparse neural networks and learning-to-optimizer (L2O). I obtained my Bachelor's Degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021.
